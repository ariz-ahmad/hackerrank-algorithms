# Notes
* simpleArraySum.py - sum() computes the sum of all elements in a list 
* compareTriplets.py - for i, j in zip(a, b) - traverse lists a and b
* diagonalDifference.py - Use negative indexing where possible, like when indexing from the right (as in right diagonal here)
* staircase.py - to print in same line: print("geeks", end =" ") and the print("geeksforgeeks") would print geeks geeksforgeeks
               - for i in range(1,n+1):
                    print " "*(n-i) + "#"*i
